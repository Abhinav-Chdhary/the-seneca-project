# The Seneca Project
Ever wondered what would seneca say about gen-z, cars or about how you feel?

This project was made for this vision, to train an AI after a famous personality, so we can have the chance to interact with any celebrated person, dead or alive. 
"In a nutshell, create a digital being with a consciousness very similar to that of a real person."
Although currently it has limited number of responses which were pre-generated.

## Tech Stack: React, MongoDB, Express.js, JavaScript, Chakra.ui

## Future work:
Add a machine learning model to this, which will complete the project objective.
